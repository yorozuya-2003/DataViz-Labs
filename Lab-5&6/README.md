# Lab-(5 & 6): Exploratory Data Analysis

This section involved performing visualization for conducting exploratory data analysis on the **Iris** and the **Wine Quality** datasets.

## Task 1: Scatter Plot Matrix for Iris Dataset
This included generating a scatter plot matrix to identify relationships among the 4 different attributes in the Iris dataset.  

## Task 2: Linear Separability of Iris Classes
This included utilizing the Iris dataset to determine which class is linearly separable. This involved creating visualization to identify whether there exists a linear boundary that can distinctly separate classes within the dataset.  

## Task 3:  Exploratory Data Analysis of Wine Quality Dataset
This included examining the dataset's features, distributions, correlations, and any notable patterns or trends present within the data.
